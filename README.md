# 🌐 Generalisable IoT Representation

This repository contains datasets and encoder implementations that will be publicly released upon acceptance of our research paper.

## 🔔 Coming Soon

### 📊 Datasets

#### **DATA25v1**
A comprehensive IoT network traffic dataset collected from February 11 to April 11, 2025 (57 days) from an updated testbed comprising consumer IoT devices representative of the 2024-2025 market. The dataset includes:
- 📈 Approximately **7.7 million flows**
- 🔌 **18 device types**, including two newer hardware generations of previously studied devices (e.g., Amazon Echo → Echo Show 5, TP-Link plug → Tapo plug) and fifteen entirely new consumer IoT device types
- 💻 A non-IoT **"IT" class** comprising general-purpose computing devices (laptops, smartphones, tablets)

#### **DATA25v2**
A companion dataset collected during the same period using identical methodology but from a separate university laboratory environment. This dataset enables cross-environment generalization evaluation and includes:
- 📈 Approximately **8.8 million flows**
- 🔌 **10 device types** with overlapping categories but different physical setup, network topology, and background traffic patterns

### 🤖 Encoder Implementations

We will release implementations of **five encoder models** studied in our work:
- ⚙️ EncoderAE
- ⚙️ EncoderVAE
- ⚙️ EncoderAEEntity
- ⚙️ EncoderAELimited
- ⚙️ EncoderVAELimited

These implementations are provided to facilitate reproducibility and further research in IoT device identification and network traffic analysis.

## ⏳ Publication Status

**Note:** The datasets and code will be made available in the appropriate directories after our research paper is accepted for publication. Please check back soon for updates.
