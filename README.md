# Gen-IoT Repository

This repository contains datasets and encoder implementations that will be publicly released upon acceptance of our research paper.

## Coming Soon

### Datasets

**DATA25v1**
A comprehensive IoT network traffic dataset collected from February 11 to April 11, 2025 (57 days) from an updated testbed comprising consumer IoT devices representative of the 2024-2025 market. The dataset includes:
- Approximately 7.7 million flows
- 18 device types, including two newer hardware generations of previously studied devices (e.g., Amazon Echo → Echo Show 5, TP-Link plug → Tapo plug) and fifteen entirely new consumer IoT device types
- A non-IoT "IT" class comprising general-purpose computing devices (laptops, smartphones, tablets)

**DATA25v2**
A companion dataset collected during the same period using identical methodology but from a separate university laboratory environment. This dataset enables cross-environment generalization evaluation and includes:
- Approximately 8.8 million flows
- 10 device types with overlapping categories but different physical setup, network topology, and background traffic patterns

### Encoder Implementations

We will release implementations of five encoder models studied in our work. These implementations are provided to facilitate reproducibility and further research in IoT device identification and network traffic analysis.

## Publication Status

**Note:** The datasets and code will be made available in the appropriate directories after our research paper is accepted for publication. Please check back soon for updates.
